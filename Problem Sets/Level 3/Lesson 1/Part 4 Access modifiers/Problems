1. For each of the following, put either public, protected, default, or private.
  a. Accessible to classes in the same package only.
  b. Accessible to classes in the same package and subclasses.
  c. Accessible everywhere.
  d. Accessible in the same class only.
  
2.
  a. Create a class named RectangularPrism that has private double instance variables length, width, and height.
  b. Create a constructor that sets the variables using parameters.
     If a parameter is negative, then set the corresponding variable to the absolute value of the parameter.
  c. Make a get method for each instance variable.
  d. Make a set method for each instance variable.
     If the parameter is negative, then set the corresponding variable to the absolute value of the parameter.
  e. Create a method named volume that returns the product of the length, width, and height.
  f. Create a method named surfaceArea that returns the surface area 2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height).
  g. Create a class named Cube that extends RectangularPrism.
     Make the constructor of the Cube so that the length, width, and height are equal.
     
3.
  a. Create a class named DoubleArrayInfo that has a private double array as an instance variable.
  b. Create a constructor that sets the array using parameters.
  c. Create a method named get that takes an index and returns the element at the index.
  d. Create a method named set that takes an index and value and sets the element at the index to the value.
  e. Create a toString method that returns a String that contains every element of the array.
  f. Create an equals method that returns true if and only if all elements are equal and in the same order.
  g. Create a method named sum that returns the sum of the elements in the array.
  h. Create a method named mean that returns the mean (average) of the elements in the array.
