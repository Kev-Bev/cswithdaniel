1. Determine whether the following statements are true or false:
  a. If A is an interface, then new A() is allowed.
  b. Interfaces cannot have instance variables.
  c. Interfaces can extend classes.
  d. Interfaces can extend interfaces.
  e. All abstract methods in interfaces are public.
  f. Abstract methods in an interface must be overriden in all classes that implement the interface.
  g. A class can extend multiple classes.
  h. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
  
  
2.
  a. Create an abstract class called Person that has instance variables
     firstName (String), lastName (String), and yearOfBirth (int).
     Create a constructor in Person that sets the instance variables.
     Create an abstract method named display in Person.

   b. Create an interface named Contactable that has a method getContactInfo that takes no parameters and returns a String.

   c. Create a class named Student that extends Person and implements Contactable.
      The Student class should have additional instance variables
      gpa (double), grade (int), email (String), and phoneNumber (String).
      Override the display method to display all the information of the Student.
      Override the getContactInfo method to return a String containing the email and phoneNumber of the Student.

   d. Create a class named Employee that extends Person and implements Contactable.
      The Employee class should have additional instance variables
      occupation (String), salary (double), email (String), and phoneNumber (String).
      Override the display method to display all the information of the Employee.
      Override the getContactInfo method to return a String containing the email and phoneNumber of the Employee.

   e. In the main class, create a method named displayAllContactInfo that
      takes an array of Contactable and prints the contact info of every element of the array.
      Create a method named displayAllInfo that
      takes an array of Person and prints the info of every element of the array (call the display method).
