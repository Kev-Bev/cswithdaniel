1. Determine whether the following statements are true or false:
  a. If A is an abstract class, then new A() is allowed.
  b. Abstract classes cannot have instance variables since you cannot create instances of them.
  c. Abstract classes can extend non-abstract classes.
  d. All methods in an abstract class must be abstract.
  e. Abstract methods can be private.
  f. Abstract methods must be overriden in non-abstract subclasses.
  g. Abstract classes must have abstract methods.
  
  
2. 
  a. Create an abstract class named Course that contains instance variables
     name (String), subject (String), and numberOfCredits (double).
  b. Create abstract method in Course named getExamDate() (that returns a String).
  c. Create a class named Java3 that extends Course. 
     In the constructor, set the name to "Java Level III", the subject to "Computer Science", and the number of credits to 1.
  d. Override the getExamDate() method to return "10/27/20".


3. Fix all errors:
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        A a = new A(7, 9);
        a.display();
    }
}
class A implements X
{
    double x, y;
    public abstract double xy()
    public A(double x, double y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
interface X
{
    void display();
}
class B extends A
{
    public int xy()
    {
        return x * y;
    }
}


4.
  a. Create an abstract class called Person that has instance variables 
     firstName (String), lastName (String), and yearOfBirth (int).
     Create a constructor in Person that sets the instance variables using parameters.
     Create an abstract method named display in Person.
  
  b. Create a class named Student that extends Person. The Student class should have additional instance variables
     gpa (double), grade (int), email (String), and phoneNumber (String).
     Override the display method to display all the information of the Student.
     
  c. Create a class named Employee that extends Person. The Employee class should have additional instance variables
     occupation (String), salary (double), email (String), and phoneNumber (String).
     Override the display method to display all the information of the Employee.

  d. In the main class, create a method named displayInfo that takes an object of type Person
     and prints all its information (calls its display() method).
     Pass an object of type Student and Employee to both methods.
